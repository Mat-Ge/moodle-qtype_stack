# Question banks in the STACK question library

STACK is distributed with a very large question bank, which contains a number of collections which arose from specific projects.

* `Algebra-Refresher` contains questions to cover all parts of the [The Map of Algebraic Manipulation](?). TODO: barnard.tex in md. 
* `Calculus-Refresher` contains questions to cover all of the [Calculus Refresher](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/content/final0502-calc-ref-ukmlsc.pdf) by Dr Tony Croft and Dr Anthony Kay.
* `HELM` contains questions from the [HELM workbooks](https://learn.lboro.ac.uk/archive/olmp/olmp_resources/pages/wbooks_fulllist.html).
